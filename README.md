## üéØ Problem Statement

"Analyzing airline punctuality in India (Jan 2024 - Sep 2024) by examining flight delays and on-time performance across different airlines to identify patterns and recommend improvements."

#### üîç Understanding Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Since we don‚Äôt have individual flight details (like delay minutes per flight), we need to analyze aggregated statistics:

üìä Primary KPIs (Most Important Metrics)
1Ô∏è. Total Departures per Airline ‚Üí Which airline handles the most flights?

2Ô∏è. Total Delays per Airline ‚Üí Which airline faces the most delays?

3Ô∏è. On-Time Performance (%) ‚Üí Which airlines are the most punctual?

4Ô∏è. Delay Rate (%) ‚Üí What % of flights are delayed per airline?
    Delay Rate=(Number of Departures/Number of Flight Delays)√ó100

5Ô∏è. Rank Airlines by Punctuality ‚Üí Sort airlines based on % on-time performance.

### Step 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing (ETL)

    Get the latest flight delay data in India Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India.
 #### Part 1 Summary: Tasks Completed

Here's a breakdown of what did in Part 1:
üîπ 1. Data Extraction (Loading the CSV)

    1.1. Read the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
    1.2. Manually checked for inconsistencies in the data.

üîπ 2. Data Cleaning & Transformation

    2.1. Identified and fixed data inconsistencies:
        2.1.1. Corrected the misspelled month (Auguest ‚Üí Aug-24).
        2.1.2. Ensured the Month column was properly formatted as a date.

    2.2. Converted data types:
        2.2.1 Fixed % On-time Performance, which was initially stored as a string.
        2.2.2 Ensured all necessary columns were converted to numeric (int/float) for calculations.

    2.3. Validated and corrected performance calculations:
        2.3.1.  Recalculated On-Time Arrival Rate using the formula:
        2.3.2. On-Time Rate=100‚àí(Flights DelayedFlights Departed√ó100)
        2.3.3. On-Time Rate=100‚àí(Flights DepartedFlights Delayed√ó100)
        2.3.4. Compared with existing values and replaced incorrect ones.

    2.4. Rounded values for consistency (2 decimal places).

    2.5. Renamed columns for better readability:
       2.5.1 % On-time Performance ‚Üí On-Time Arrival Rate (%)
       2.5.2 Calculated Performance ‚Üí Delay Rate (%)

üîπ 3. Data Loading (Saving the Processed Data)
    Saved the cleaned and transformed data into a new CSV file.

#### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL
Dataset Overview:

1. Columns: Airline, Month, Number of Departures, Number of Flights Delayed, On-Time Performance (%),Delay Rate.
2. Time Period: January 2024 - September 2024.
3. Data Source: Processed dataset after cleaning and validation.

Example quieres perfomed on the dataset:

    " SELECT
        DATE_FORMAT(month, '%b %Y') AS month_name,
        AVG((flights_delayed / departures) * 100) AS avg_delay_rate
        FROM flight_performance
        GROUP BY month
        ORDER BY month;
    "
    
The outputs of EDA analysis are backed up by the step-3
EDA using SQL provides insights into flight delays across months and airlines. The analysis highlights:

1. Seasonal Trends ‚Äì Certain months experience higher delays.

2. Airline Performance ‚Äì Some airlines consistently perform better in punctuality.

3. Operational Insights ‚Äì Airlines can use this data to improve scheduling and customer service.

#### Step 3: Data Transformation and visualization in Tableau

#### Step 4: Summary of findings
Summary of Findings:
###### 1Ô∏è. Monthly Average Delay Trends:

    1. January & July had the highest average delay rates (43.4% & 42.9%), indicating possible seasonal or operational challenges.
    2. March to June showed the lowest delays (27-32%), suggesting smoother operations during these months.
    3. August & September had moderate delays (~39%), possibly due to monsoon-related disruptions.

##### 2 Ô∏è. Airline Performance & Delays & Ranking:

    1. Indigo had the most departures but a manageable delay rate (29.3%), showing strong operational efficiency.
    2. SpiceJet & Alliance Air had the highest delay rates (50.6% & 47.0%), indicating severe on-time performance issues.
    3. Air India also faced significant delays (36.5%), despite fewer departures.
    4. Vistara, Akasa Air, and AIX Connect showed relatively better performance, with delay rates around 24-28%.

##### 3.Overall Insights:

    1. Delays peak in winter (January) and monsoon months (July-August), possibly due to weather conditions.
    2. Some airlines struggle with on-time performance more than others, suggesting a need for better scheduling and fleet management.
    3. Further analysis on airport congestion and time-of-day delays could provide deeper insights into delay patterns.
